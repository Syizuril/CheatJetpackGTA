Android Kotlin Cheatsheet
=========================

Get Started
-----------
* To install Android Studio, go to [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and follow the instructions to download and install it.
* To see an app's Android hierarchy in the Project pane, click the Project tab in the vertical tab column. Then select Android in the drop-down menu at the top.
* When you need to add new dependencies to your project or change dependency versions, edit the `build.gradle(Module:app)` file.
* All code and resources for an app are located within the `app` and `res` folders. The `java` folder includes activities, tests, and other components in Kotlin or Java source code (or both). The `res` folder holds resources, such as layouts, strings, and images.
* To add features, components, and permissions to your Android app, edit the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. All app components, such as additional activities, must be declared in this XML file.
* To create an Android virtual device (an emulator) to run your app, use the [AVD Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).
* To run your app on a physical Android device using Android Studio, enable USB debugging on the device. To do this, open **Settings > About phone** and tap **Build number** seven times. Then open **Settings > Developer options** and select **USB debugging**.
